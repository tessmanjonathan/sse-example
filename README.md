# sse-example

Example API controller implementing [Server Side Events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html) within an [EmbedIO](https://github.com/unosquare/embedio) server.

The testing project shows an example of a client connecting to the api to consume events. This sets up the same web server and connects with http client for self contained testing.
